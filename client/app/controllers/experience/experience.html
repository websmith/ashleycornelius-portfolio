            <h1>My Expertise</h1>
            <p>I'm Ash, a graphic designer living in awesome Austin, Texas.</p>
            <p>"Graphic designer" can mean a lot of things these days. For me, it means creating a custom design with thought and care. I take pride in creating thoughtful designs that will drive the message of your brand and make a mark in your industry. I love the details of design and how they work together to creating meaningful and cohesive deliverables. I find pure joy in handmade goods and art and love to incorporate my love of DIY into my designs.</p> 
            <p>I have over 5 years of experience in my field to lean on when it comes to creating custom branding, social media design and marketing as well as Wordpress design.</p>
            <p>Feel free to give me a shout!</p>
